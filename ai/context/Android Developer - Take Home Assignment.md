# **Android Developer \- Take Home Assignment**

## **Overview**

Build a voice recording app with transcription and summary generation that handles real-world edge cases. **Please try to replicate the UI/UX of the existing TwinMind App on the App Store/Play Store.**

 **Timeline:** 2 days (48 hours)  
 **Tech Stack:** Kotlin, Jetpack Compose, MVVM, Coroutines & Flow  
 **Minimum SDK:** API 24 (Android 7.0)

---

## **What You'll Build**

**3 core features only:**

1. **Record Audio Robustly** \- Background recording with explicit interruptions handling   
2. **Generate Transcript** \- Convert audio to transcript.  
3. **Generate Summary** \- Create structured summary from transcript.

---

## **Requirements**

### **1\. Record Audio** 

#### **Recording Service:**

* Foreground service that records audio  
* Split into 30-second (audio) chunks  
* Save chunks to local storage  
* Persistent notification with Stop action

#### **Critical Edge Cases to Handle:**

1. **Incoming/Outgoing phone calls**  
* Pause recording when call starts  
* Show status: "Paused \- Phone call"  
* Resume when call ends  
2. **Audio focus loss**  
* Pause when other apps take audio focus  
* Show ‘Paused – Audio focus lost’ as a persistent foreground notification with Resume/Stop actions.  
* Resume when focus regained  
3.  **Microphone source changes**  
* Bluetooth headset connect/disconnect → continue recording  
* Wired headset plug/unplug → continue recording  
* Show notification when source changes  
4. **Low storage**  
* Check storage before starting  
* Stop gracefully if storage runs out  
* Show error: "Recording stopped \- Low storage"  
5. **Process death recovery**  
* Persist session state in Room and enqueue a termination worker to finalize the last chunk and resume transcription on restart.  
6. **Silent Audio Detection**  
* Recording is silent (no audio input)  
* Detect after 10 seconds of silence  
* Show warning: "No audio detected \- Check microphone"  
7. **Record 30-second chunks with \~2-second overlap to preserve speech continuity across chunk boundaries.**  
8. **Live Updates \- Android 16**   
   Show live recording status on lock screen:  
* Recording timer (updates every second)  
* Current status ("Recording" / "Paused \- Phone call")  
* Pause/Stop actions  
* Visual indicator (recording icon)

#### **UI:**

* Single recording/post meeting screen  
* Record/Stop button  
* Timer (00:00)  
* Status indicator:  
  * "Recording..."  
  * "Paused \- Phone call"  
  * "Paused \- Audio focus lost"  
  * "Stopped"  
* List all the meeting on the Dashboard

###    **2\. Generate Transcript**

* Upload chunks as and when the 30 second chunk is ready to transcription API  
* Use **OpenAI Whisper** or **Google Gemini 2.5 Flash** or **mock**  
* Save to Room database and keep as the single source of truth.  
* Transcript must be in correct order.  
* Retry transcribing **ALL** the audio if there is some failure.  
* Don't lose audio chunks

---

### **3\. Generate Summary**

* Send transcript to LLM API  
* Generate structured summary and **stream it in the UI.**  
* Update the UI as and when the summary response comes.  
* Show specific error message  
* The summary should get generated even if the user kill the app while generating the summary

#### **UI:**

* Summary screen with 4 sections:  
  * Title  
  * Summary  
  * Action Items   
  * Key Points   
* Loading state: "Generating summary..."  
* Error state with Retry button

---

## **Technical Requirements**

### **Architecture**

* **MVVM:** ViewModel → Repository → DAO/API  
* **Hilt:** Dependency injection  
* **Room:** Local database  
* **Retrofit:** API calls (or mock)  
* **Compose:** 100% Jetpack Compose  
* **Coroutines \+ Flow:** Async operations
